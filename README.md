# Speak Number Guess

Number guessing game where you speak your guess into the microphone using the speech recognition API

## Description

This a number guessing game that uses speech recognition to capture the user's guess.

It initializes a constant variable `msgEl` to store the HTML element with ID `msg`, which will be used to display messages to the user.

It generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `getRandomNumber()` function.

It sets up a speech recognition object using the `SpeechRecognition()` constructor.

It starts the speech recognition service using the `start()` method.

When the user speaks, the `onSpeak()` function is called. It captures the user's speech and passes it to the `writeMessage()` and `checkNumber()` functions.

The `writeMessage()` function displays the user's speech in the HTML element stored in `msgEl`.

The `checkNumber()` function checks if the user's speech is a valid number between 1 and 100. If the speech is not a valid number, an error message is displayed. If the speech is valid, the function checks if the number is equal to the randomly generated number. If the numbers match, a congratulatory message is displayed and a "Play Again" button is added to the page. If the user's guess is too high or too low, a message is displayed indicating which direction the user should go.

The `getRandomNumber()` function generates a random number between 1 and 100 using the `Math.random()` and `Math.floor()` methods.

It sets up event listeners for the speech recognition service, the end of the speech recognition service, and a click event for the "Play Again" button. If the "Play Again" button is clicked, the page is reloaded.

Overall, this code implements a simple number guessing game using speech recognition to capture the user's guess.
